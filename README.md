# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Installation Guide

## Pre-requisite
`yarn` and `node` is installed.

## Steps-by-Steps
1. Go to your preferred directory and do a git clone:
```
git clone https://github.com/ShraqueOatMeal/hr-managing-system.git
```
2. run `yarn install`:
```
cd hr-managing-system
yarn install
```
3. run `yarn run dev` to start your development server:
```
yarn run dev
```
4. It should run on a local host that might look something like this: `localhost:5173`
5. As for now go to `localhost:5173/EmployeeDetails` to see the UI
